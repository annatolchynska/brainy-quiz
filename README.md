   ###Bugs and Unfixed bugs
   * On the stage of testing the following error was showing on the console in the Devtools:

   <img src ="./assets/images/error.png" alt="screenshot of error">.

   it was fixed by entering the following code in the head section of the html file: `<link rel="shortcut icon" href="#">`.
   * The score wasn't resetting properly, so I added this line of code to `startGame()` function `scoreText.innerText = score;` and it fixed the problem.
   * The start button was working from the second click. To fix this I rewrote the code from this: 

```js 

   document.getElementById('go').addEventListener('click', () => { 
 if (welcome.style.display === "block") {
        welcome.style.display = "none";
   } else {
       welcome.style.display = "block";
    }
    if (welcome.style.display === "none") {
       quiz.style.display = "block";
        startGame();`
    } else {
      quiz.style.display = "none";
   }
});

```
   to this: 

```js

   button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    welcome.style.display = 'none';
    quiz.style.display = 'block';
    startGame();
});

```

   * No other bugs were found.

   ### Deployment
* The site was deployed to GitHub pages by following steps:
   * Git Hub repository choose Settings tab and Pages
   * From drop down menu source section pick main Branch
   * once the Save button been clicked the page provided the link to the completed website.
